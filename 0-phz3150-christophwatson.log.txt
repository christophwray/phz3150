Major: Computational Physics
Year: Juninor

How did you hear about this course? The academic director of the physics department told me to take this class over Introduction to Programing with C. 
Do you have a laptop you can bring to class, install software on, etc.? Yes
What operating system and version does it run? macOS Sequoia 14.6.1 
How much free disk space does it have? 20.11 GB
What operating systems are you comfortable working in? macOS
What computer classes have you taken, including high school,
extracurricular, etc.? Harvard CS50x Introduction to Programming
Have you ever programmed a computer? Yes
In what language(s)? C and Python
Summarize your experience: Very basic understanding of memory allocation, variables, pointers, ascii, for loops, libraries, and the use of them to get the computer to do cool stuff. 
Have you taken statistics or probability? No, but I am learning extracurricularly 
Why are you taking this course? I want to learn to apply mathematics and physics to model and solve problems with a computer.
Are there particular topics you hope to learn? Machine learning and data analysis. 
If you have worked with scientific data or modeling before, briefly
describe your experience: I have worked with the SEER database in undergraduate research. But I do want to get more involved with data analysis and modeling so I can do more research here at UCF. 
Have you ever been involved with a science club or similar? If so,
describe: Before I graduated from Seminole State College I was a Scholar of the National Science Foundation. That is why I participated in undergraduate research there. But it was a small school so I am much more excited to be a part of the scientific organizations here.

Opened log as jupyter notebook, no longer a test file. Fixed all errors with pushing to git and issues affecting homework 2. Please note, this log is only after resoving these issues and there was no long during issues with homework two completion. 
Howmework Problem #1:
// This is my first jupyter practice notebook.  
Syntax is the punctuation and format of a sentence: 
thiS may be, an EXAMPLE of incorrect; syntax and cOrrect characters}
Wyile thes wuuld be an examplb of incprrevt charectors and corract syntex. 0r th!$. 
Both sentences would not be interepreted by the computer (as programming languages) because the computer only speak binary. Humans guess based on context so we can work though the erros but to a computer, these are not "errors" they are just zeros and ones. If we put the incorrect sequence of letters which is then translated to ascii and compiled to binary it will be undetectable to a computer.
Howmework Problem #2:
